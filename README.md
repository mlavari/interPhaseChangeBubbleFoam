# interPhaseChangeBubbleFoam

Hi folks,

interPhaseChangeBubbleFoam is a multi-phase solver that can consider bubbles in both the Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks.

How to use it:

Please source OpenFOAM version 2406, and then run the script ./Allrun. This will compile the solver and execute all tutorial cases. In each case study directory, there is a ParaView "state" file that can be used to import the pipelines used to visualize the results in this work.

Thanks,
ML
